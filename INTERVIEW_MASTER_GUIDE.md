# 🐍 Python & DevOps Interview Master Guide
*A Comprehensive Roadmap by "Aaron Maxwell" (Persona)*

Welcome. This repository is structured to take you from "Junior Script Writer" to "Senior DevOps Engineer" capable of crushing FAANG/MANGA interviews. 

Stop memorizing code. Start understanding **Systems** and **Patterns**.

---

## 📚 1. Core Methodology (Start Here)
Before you write code, you must learn how to *think*.
*   [**Pseudocode Methodology**](./PSEUDOCODE_METHODOLOGY.md)  
    *   *The "3-Pass Read" Technique*
    *   *How to write "Pro" Pseudocode*
    *   *Avoiding "Deceptive Simplicity" Traps*

---

## 🧠 2. Algorithm Patterns & Logic
Don't just solve problems. Recognize patterns.
*   [**Standard Algorithms Guide**](./INTERVIEW_PSEUDOCODE_GUIDE.md)  
    *   *String Parsing, Sliding Windows, Hash Maps, etc.*
    *   *Includes: Reconstruct Sentence, Group Anagrams, LRU Cache.*
*   [**Advanced / "Dirty" Algorithms**](./ADVANCED_DEVOPS_ALGO_GUIDE.md)  
    *   *Real-world scenarios designed to make you fail.*
    *   *Includes: Credit Card Sorting (Multi-Key), Server Bin Packing (Knapsack), Dependency Graphs.*
*   [**Practice Set (Quick Drills)**](./scripts/interview_practice_set.py)  
    *   *Hands-on exercises: Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, Merge Intervals, Subarray Sum.*

---

## ⚙️ 3. DevOps & Systems Knowledge
The "Ops" in DevOps.
*   [**Kubernetes Concepts**](./KUBERNETES_CONCEPTS.md)  
    *   *Pods, Services, Ingress, Troubleshooting.*
*   [**Python Concepts**](./PYTHON_CONCEPTS.md)  
    *   *Generators, Decorators, Concurrency, Memory Management.*

---

## 4. Code Repository (The "Answers")
Run these. Break these. Modify these.
*   `scripts/faang_interview_challenges.py` - **(NEW)** *Rate Limiters, Merging Logs, & Tree Serialization.*
*   `scripts/reconstruct_sentence.py` - *The classic "Index:Word" sorting trap.*
*   `scripts/advanced_devops_algos.py` - *Credit Cards, Bin Packing, & Graphs.*
*   `scripts/interview_practice_set.py` - *Core FAANG patterns with sample inputs/outputs.*
*   `scripts/01_log_parsing.py` - *Basic log manipulation.*
*   `scripts/10_k8s_debugging.py` - *Mock K8s troubleshooting.*

---

## 🧐 5. The Audit (Self-Correction)
*   [**FAANG Codebase Audit**](./FAANG_REVIEW.md)  
    *   *A critique of this very repo from a Staff Engineer's perspective.*
    *   *Read this to learn how to critique your OWN code in an interview.*

## 🛠 6. The "Aaron Maxwell" Advice Column
**Q: "I struggle with reading the problem."**  
**A:** Use the [Pseudocode Methodology](./PSEUDOCODE_METHODOLOGY.md). Read it three times. Identify the constraints.

**Q: "How do I sort by two things at once?"**  
**A:** Python Tuple Sorting. `data.sort(key=lambda x: (x.primary, -x.secondary))`. See [Advanced Algorithms](./ADVANCED_DEVOPS_ALGO_GUIDE.md).

**Q: "Do I need to memorize Knapsack?"**  
**A:** No, but you need to recognize it. If you see "Maximize resource usage with a limit," that is Knapsack. See "Server Bin Packing" in [Advanced Algorithms](./ADVANCED_DEVOPS_ALGO_GUIDE.md).
